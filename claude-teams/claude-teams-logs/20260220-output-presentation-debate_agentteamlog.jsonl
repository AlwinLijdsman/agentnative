Analyzed 3 sessions: prime-falls (FAILED output), cool-hill (SUCCESSFUL output), high-meadow (empty). Identified 3 failure modes: (1) Stage gate bypass (FIXED), (2) Stage 5 non-compliance with non-blocking validation (UNFIXED), (3) Latent file link regex mismatch (UNFIXED). Root cause for current bug is agent LLM non-determinism in Stage 5 + non-blocking validation allowing incomplete output. Posted 4 moderator SEBs + hypothesis scoreboard."}
