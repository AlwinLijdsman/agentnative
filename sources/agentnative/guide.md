# AgentNative

The AgentNative monorepo - source code for the Craft Agent desktop application.

## Scope

Full access to the agentnative codebase at `C:\dev\deving\agentnative`, including:
- Electron app (`apps/`)
- Shared packages (`packages/`)
- Build scripts (`scripts/`)
- Configuration files (tsconfig, pnpm workspace, etc.)

## Guidelines

- This is a TypeScript/Electron monorepo managed with pnpm
- Read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root for project conventions and architecture
- Use Glob and Grep to navigate the codebase efficiently
- Check `package.json` files for available scripts and dependencies
